# Hey there, I’m Rai! 👋  
🖥️ **.NET magician** | 🔥 **React wrangler** | 🗄️ **Database whisperer**  

I break things so I can fix them better. Mostly coding in **C# & Blazor**, building cool stuff with **SQL, React and whatever I like**, and making sure my queries don’t take a lifetime to run.  

## 🚀 What I’m up to:  
- 🏗️ Writing **.NET APIs** and making them behave  
- 🔐 Playing with **authentication & security** like it’s a puzzle  
- ⚡ Tweaking **databases** so they don’t explode under pressure  
- 🤓 Occasionally questioning my life choices when debugging  

## ⚡ Other fun facts:  
- 🧠 I like **psychology, mythology, and all things mysterious**  
- ✍️ Sometimes I write—code, blogs, and maybe even books  
- 🛸 If I disappear, I’m probably lost in a deep-dive about some random topic  

## 📌 Let’s connect & build something awesome!
